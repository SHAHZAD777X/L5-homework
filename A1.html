   <h1>BIRYANI</h1>
    <P>Biryani  is a mixed rice dish popular in South Asia, made with rice, meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef) or
    seafood (prawns or fish), and spices. To cater to vegetarians, the meat or seafood can be substituted with vegetables or
    paneer.[1] Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.[2]
    
    Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora,</P>

<P>One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: برنج), the Persian word for rice.[7][8] Another theory states
that it was derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: بریان), which means "to fry" or "to roast".[9][10][11] It may
alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: برشتن) which also means "to roast (onions)", as the
dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spicesBiryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often
associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in Iran, Iraq,
Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines.[4][citation needed] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian,Pakistani
online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India and Pakistan.[5][6]</P>
